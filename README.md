# PRISM30
This project explores a novel application of Anthropic's API to create a dynamic, open-ended personality assessment. Unlike traditional fixed-question tests (that we've all suffered through), it engages users in open-ended questions in a brand-new model of the entire personality that I call PRISM (Personality Resonance Integrated Spectrum Model). The questions adapt based on the user responses. The system analyzes the semantic content, emotional nuances, and linguistic patterns in user inputs to extract multidimensional personality traits, a challenging task that pushes the boundaries of current large language model capabilities. In other words, it could only be done with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet. :-)

The assessment synthesizes then scores this data before rendering it into a visually intuitive PRISM Personality Flower, offering users a unique perspective on their psychological profile. By leveraging advanced natural language processing in the realm of personality evaluation, this project opens up new possibilities for AI-assisted psychological insights. It demonstrates the potential for more nuanced, accessible, and comprehensive personality assessments, which could have significant implications for fields ranging from personal development to organizational psychology.

This project has me inspired. I'm going to take it and adapt it into a 50-dimensional personality model that captures all aspects of humanity. This will take weeks (months, years) but I think that by using AI, we can truly understand what makes a human, human.
